## What is a ShadowCat?

ShadowCat is a new VPN project that offers flexible VPN services with a pay-as-you-go model.

Your first ShadowCat is completely free and can be used on any device. However, this free service is limited to one region and can be accessed on only one device at a time.

Additional ShadowCats are charged on a per-region, per-device basis. You have the freedom to choose between a prepaid model or a subscription model. With the prepaid model, we accept one-time payments without the need to enter your credit card details or bind with your online payment accounts, such as PayPal.
